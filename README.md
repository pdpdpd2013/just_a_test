testing the project management function of GitGub

Hi, there. I am Li Duo from Shanghai, China. I am now pursuing my PHD degree in Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

Most of the projects that I upload this week is the projects that I have completed about two to three years ago when I was an undergraduate student.

The projects are related to embedded system development, Android development, and image processing.

The languages that I am familiar with is C++. I also use Java and Matlab when necessary.

If you want to contact with me, please send me an e-mail.
